# PoE-Trade

PoE-Trade is a Pathofexile.com trading app that enables players to trade between each other. All you have to do is search the item you are looking for, and it'll return the list of players who are currently looking to sell the item.

## Motivation

I made this website as a challenge to see if I can mimic the functionality of pathofexile.com/trade. In addition, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can provide a better mobile first approach than the original website attempted.
